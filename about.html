  <h2>My Journey</h2>
  <h4>My journey of life up until now took a huge turning point in 2021. The pandemic had just started to fade
      into the past and I arrived in the United States. Life was somewhat difficult at that point but perseverance
      and sheer will brought me to this summit of life. I worked my firt job as a back-of-house cook in an Asian
      restaurant for about 3 months until I realised it wasn't what my dream was. My next job was a hospital as an
      Environmental Technician/housekeeper for about 1 year after which I was promoted to Lead Environmental Technician.
      After a few months, another hospital offered me a job in their Consumer cycle department. I worked as a consumer 
      Access Specialist for over a year before my vision became set on what feels like my true calling.

  <h4>Working as a Consumer Access Specialist, there was a lot of typing involved, which I soon became very good at. My first
    taste of graphic design was actually in that role as well. I was part of a committee that featured many visual presentations
    such as using Microsoft Powerpoint to enliven meetings. I hated "basic". So when I was asked to prepare the next presentation, I 
   poured my heart and soul into it. The feedback from the team was unreal. I instantly thought,"What if I could do this with a website?!"
    The following week, I went on a trip to Seattle, Washington and this is where I found true inspiration. Towering skyscrapers for huge Tech 
    Corporations was the last colorful straw for me. I couldn't afford an expensive Web development course so I found one for $30 and here we 
    are today.</h4>

    <h4>In this amazing journey of life, I would not have achieved many things without the help of many people around me. I would love to give
        a big thank you to GOD for placing the other people in my life and also bringing me through every struggle. I would also like to thank
        my parents, my fantastic wife and my friends. These people have made significant contributions to my wellbeing and I will forever be 
        grateful. To all those that worked behind the scenes to aid in my success, THANK YOU!

    <h2>My Message to You</h2>
    <h4>In this journey called life, not everything will be perfect. There are times when things will be absolutely horrible.
        There are other times when life will be smoother than MJ's Moonwalk. One thing that I know for sure is that if you put
        alittle effort and time into improving yourself, life will get better, much better, much faster. There are resources
        everywhere. Grow these habits and watch your life improve drastically.
        <ul>
         <li>Read books(Do not take this lightly). Reading has improved my life extraordinarily.
         <li>Exercise, atleast once per day. Your physical health is extremely valuable.</li> 
         <li>Spend time with your family and friends.This is where you will find motivation.</li>
         <li>Be a sponge. Learn as much as you can, any and everything. The world becomes much simpler to understand.</li>
        </ul>
