    <h3>1. TOP GUN: MAVERICK</h3>
    This movie  is a classic American film that features all </br>my favourite genres. Fighter jet action? Love it! Drama and </br>alittle bit of comedy? Amazingggg! The soundtrack? Immaculate!

<h3>2. FAST AND FURIOUS 5 </h3>
Within the FF sequel, this movie in my opinion, is the best one</br> yet. Everything seems realistic enough. The action, the drama,<br> the plot are all amazingly put together. As we all know, after this one,<br> every other one that came was a complete bust, the laws of physics were<br> absolutely violated and reality just went right out the door.

<h3>3. THE HITMAN'S BODYGUARD</h3>
Now this movie has got to be one of the funniest movies I have ever<br> watched in my life. It features two of my favorite actors, <br>Ryan Reynolds and Samuel Jackson. The plot is centered around Reynolds<br> acting as a bodyguard to the protect the life of Infamous hitman, Darius Kincaid(Jackson).
